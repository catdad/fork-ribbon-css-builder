##"Fork me on GitHub" Ribbon Builder

Pure CSS "For me on GitHub" ribbon generator

##How to

The builder is located at [catdad.github.io/fork-ribbon-css-builder](http://catdad.github.io/fork-ribbon-css-builder). Once there, you can preview the ribbon, change some attributes, and copy the code.

##Note

This project is in no way endorced or sponsored by GitHub. I just wanted pure CSS ribbons that do not load an image. If you want the official ribbons, you can get them here: https://github.com/blog/273-github-ribbons

This ribbon is meant to be simplified version of GitHub's ribbons, and is not a picture perfect copy in CSS. If that is what you are looking for, try these: https://github.com/simonwhitaker/github-fork-ribbon-css
